### overview

it hvae a long time that i havent wrote a blog, recently,i am dealing with a project,which include the regular expression knowledge in perl languge,so what is regular expression ? as the name say, it is not hard understant that regular expression is you define "regular" to do something,because there are lot of pro-artcial to explain the regular expression,so i just write something in my own perspective though the example in case i forget it,let's break it down

### example

![regular](/assets/images/regular.jpg)

<li>STEP 1 </li>

`$line` is a virible in perl,you can define a varible by the `$`.*
`=~` is pattern bindig in perl used to binding regular expression
let us see `/` ,there are three type of regular expresson in genaral, which is
`match` regular,`m//`
`replace` regular,`s///`
`transliterate` regular, `tr///`

you might get confused about that there isnt the `m` in this example above ,that is because if the regular expression is `m//` in perl ,you tatoly can drop it,they are exactly in the same way.

the next is `$filename` ,is a varible ,that mean to match the value of `$filename` in `$line`

the next is `\s` that means match whitspace

*NOTE: you should not see the regular expression seperate,you should see them as whole part,that mean you can not see the current regular expression plus before* 

so you should see `/$filename\s` as a whole to match the `$line`

the next is `+` that mean the `\s` whilespace ocurres one or more time

the next is `offest`,to search `offest` in `$line`
the next is `\s*`,the `*` and the `+` are both `gread pattern regular expression` mean how many times to match

.....

let us see the `(\d+)`and `(\w+)`,this is a `group` defined by `()`.`\d` means to match number,`\w`means to match the word chracter

 <li> Step 2 </li>

the cold  above is actually math a line content of a file in my project, the file content just like this bellow

`offset = 2 lastlinelength = 5 lastlineinfo = abcd`

yeah,you are riht,the code is to serch this format content
